# Code-Reviewer-THT

## Contents
1. Section A
   * I did a code review on option C of the take-home test, which was on a Caesar Cypher in TypeScript.
   * In the Section A folder is a markdown file with the review covering completeness, efficiency, style and documentation.
   * I have also included the positive aspects and possible improvements that could be implemented in the code provided.
1. Section B
    * Task requirements can be found in the Section B folder.
    * I have included a README file with more information on the task as well as a text file with the URL to the repository.
    * The link takes you to a project that I am proud of as it taught me how to combine the basic concepts.
1. Section C
    * All files for this program can be found in the Section C folder.
    * I have included both a README and a how_to_run text file to explain how to use my program.
    * There is also a Dockerfile and a test suite.
    * I have created a markdown file on the space complexity of my created function in this folder too.
1. Section D
    * Here I provide a link to a loom video in which I answered the questions asked in the take home test to get to know me better as well as to explain my backups in the event of power outages.
