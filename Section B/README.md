## Project
This is the link to a project that I am proud of. It is a type of task manager program where users can add, remove and search for a task file to determine which tasks are assigned to them among other uses.

Although this is not a very complex project, it challenged me extensively and I learned the importance of using basic principles like for loops, if statements, while loops and dictionaries to make a well-functioning program that can determine what to put in the command console based on which user is logged in to the program.
