# Code Review

## Correctness
In general, the code is correct and functional. The created function `caesar_cipher` requires a shift value and a string, and  returns the encoded string using the Caesar cipher. It correctly handles special characters and the case where the shift value is above 26 by taking the modulus. The test case provided produces the expected output.

## Efficiency
In this instance, the alphabet is hardcoded and relatively small, so the impact of using the `indexOf` method (in lines 21-23) on the program performance would be minimal, but in situations where there are larger strings involved, a more efficient approach may be required.

## Style
The code follows good TypeScript practices. The chosen variable names are descriptive and follow camelCase naming conventions. The comments explain the code well, which makes it easy to understand what each section is for. Code is also indented nicely and whitespace is used effectively.

## Documentation
The comments explain the code well but lacks a general summary of what the program aims to do or how it should be used, which would be helpful as it will give a reader an understanding of the program without having to go through the whole function.

## Positive Aspects and Improvements
1. Positive Aspects:
	* Variable names are descriptive.
	* Comments are clear and easy to understand.
	* Special characters are handled correctly.
	* Test code provided worked well.
1. Improvements:
	* In line 5, the shift variable is created as a string but is only ever used as a number, so declaring it as a number in the beginning would be helpful.
	* A brief introduction to the program would be helpful.
	* In the section line 21-23, using the `indexOf` method might not be the most efficient when larger strings are involved.
