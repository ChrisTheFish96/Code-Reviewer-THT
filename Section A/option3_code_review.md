# Code Review

## Correctness
In general the code is correct and functional. The created function `caesar_cipher` takes in a shift value and a string, and then returns the encoded string by using the Caesar cipher. It correctly handles special characters as well as the case where the shift value is above 26 by taking the modulus. The test case provided produces the output that is expected.

## Efficiency
In this instance, the alphabet is hardcoded and relatively small, so the impact of using the `indexOf` method (in lines 21-23) on the program performance would be minimal, but in situations where there are larger strings involved a more efficient approach may be required.

## Style
The code follows good TypeScript practices. The chosen variable names are descriptive and follow camelCase naming conventions. The code is also commented well which makes it easy to understand what each section is doing. Code is also indented nicely and whitespace is used effectively.

## Documentation
Code is well commented but lacks an overall explanation of what the program aims to do or how it should be used, which would be helpful as it will give a reader a quick brief understanding of the program without having to go through the whole function and read comments.

## Positive Aspects and Improvements
1. Positive Aspects:
	* Variable names are descriptive.
	* Comments are clear and easy to understand.
	* Special characters are handled correctly.
	* Test code provided worked well.
1. Improvements:
	* In line 5, the shift variable is created as a string but is only ever used as a number, so declaring it as a number from the start would be helpful.
	* A brief introduction to the program would be helpful.
	* In the section line 21-23, using `indexOf` method might not be the most efficient when larger strings are involved.
